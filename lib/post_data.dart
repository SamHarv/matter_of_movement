        'Many have a tendency to de-prioritise sleep in favour of activities such '
        'as work, socialising, or "one more" episode of their favourite show, '
        'when in reality, sleep should be protected and prioritised.\n\n'
        'I went through a phase when working with people living with chronic '

        'It got to the point where I was over-analysing my sleep, which I now '

        'My recommendation is to adhere to some sleep hygiene practices '
        'which work for you, and to otherwise not stress about it.\n\n'
        'First, why do we need adequate sleep?\n\n'
        'I recommend reading "Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker, but in short, '
        'a few of the key benefits of sleep are as follows:\n'
        '- Learning and memory consolidation\n'
        '- Stress reduction\n'
        '- Reduced inflammation\n'
        '- Improved immune function\n'

        '- Improved mood\n'
        '- Improved hormone regulation\n\n'
        'The list goes on.\n\n'
        'The National Sleep Foundation recommends the following sleep durations '
        'for different age groups:\n'
        '- Newborns (0-3 months): 14-17 hours\n'
        '- Infants (4-11 months): 12-15 hours\n'
        '- Toddlers (1-2 years): 11-14 hours\n'
        '- Preschoolers (3-5): 10-13 hours\n'
        '- School age children (6-13): 9-11 hours\n'
        '- Teenagers (14-17): 8-10 hours\n'
        '- Younger adults (18-25): 7-9 hours\n'
        '- Adults (26-64): 7-9 hours\n'
        '- Older adults (65+): 7-8 hours\n\n'
        'These are just guidelines, and some people may require more or less sleep.\n\n'
        'It should be individualised based on how you feel and perform.\n\n'
        'Finally, how can we improve our sleep?\n\n'
        'Sleep hygiene is a term used to describe a set of practices and habits '
        'that may be helpful to imrpove sleep.\n\n'
        'This does not mean hygiene in the sense of having a shower before bed, '
        'but rather, it refers to '
        'habits and practices that are conducive to sleeping well on a regular basis.\n\n'
        'Some of these practices include:\n'
        '- Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day\n'
        '- Avoiding large meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime\n'
        '- Exercising regularly but not too strenuously close to bed time\n'
        '- Getting exposure to sunlight at the start of your day\n'
        '- Making your sleep environment comfortable, dark, quiet and cool\n'
        '- Limiting exposure to screens close to bed time\n'
        '- Not using your bed for activities other than sleep and sex\n'
        '- Going to bed when you are tired - catching the sleep wave, rather than '
        'trying to force sleep\n\n'
        'An important note on napping:\n\n'
        'Napping is completely ok.\n\n'
        'Many cultures have a siesta, which can be referred to as a biphasic sleep '
        'pattern.\n\n'
        'This can be beneficial for people who struggle to get enough '
        'sleep at night.\n\n'
        'It is important to develop a routine that works for you and limit your '
        'nap time to 30-90 minutes.\n\n'
        'Again, I reiterate that while sleep is important, you should not obsess '
        'over it and try to analyse everything. This will only lead to you being '
        'less able to sleep by fixating on minor fluctuations which are normal.',

        'The Australian physical activity guidelines are a great place to start when '
        'planning to partake in exercise, but you must remember exercise should be tailored to '
        'specific needs and preferences to ensure the best outcomes.\n\n'
        'For adults in Australia, the following is recommended (Department of Health '
        'and Aged Care, 2021):\n'
        '- 150-300 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity (moderate '
        'intensity can be identified by elevated breathing, but still being able to '
        'hold a conversation)\n'

        '- A combination of the above two\n'

        '- Resistance training (weights) is recommended at least 2 days '
        'per week (I think 3-5 is effective for best results).\n\n'
        'The mode of exercise you choose should be something you are capable of '
        'enjoying, and can include an array of activities such as walking, jogging, '
        'cycling, swimming, various sports, wood chopping, yoga, etc. Anything which '

        'The biggest tip I could give in your exercise journey is to experiment.\n\n'
        'Try rock climbing, or hiking, or anything that gets your blood pumping.\n\n'
        'The key is to find something you can enjoy so it will be sustainable.\n\n'
        'Three 60 minute bouts of lawn bowls a week over 3 months is far more '
